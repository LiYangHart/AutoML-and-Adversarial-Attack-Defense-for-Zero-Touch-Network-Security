# AutoML-and-Adversarial-Attack-Defense-for-Zero-Touch-Network-Security
This repository includes code for the AutoML-based IDS and adversarial attack defense case studies presented in the paper "Enabling AutoML for Zero-Touch Network Security: Use-Case Driven Analysis" published in IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management.

The complete code will be shared soon. 

- A comprehensive **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)** tutorial code can be found in: [AutoML-Implementation-for-Static-and-Dynamic-Data-Analytics](https://github.com/Western-OC2-Lab/AutoML-Implementation-for-Static-and-Dynamic-Data-Analytics)  
   * Including **automated data pre-processing, automated feature engineering, automated model selection, hyperparameter optimization, and automated model updating** (concept drift adaptation).
   * For cybersecurity and intrusion detection system development in both static and dynamic networking environments.
